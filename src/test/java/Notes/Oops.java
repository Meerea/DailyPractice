1.Java OOPS:

1.Object
2.Class
3.Inheritance
4.Polymorphism
5.Abstraction
6.Encapsulation


Objects:
An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. An object contains an address and takes up some space in memory.
Objects can communicate without knowing the details of each other's data or code.
The only necessary thing is the type of message accepted and the type of response returned by the objects

Class:
Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.
Class doesn't consume any space


Inheritance:
When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance
It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism
method overloading - Complile time polymorphism
method overriding - run time  polymorphism.

Abtraction:
Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction.
Java bean is the fully encapsulated class because all the data members are private

Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is used for access restriction to class members and methods.
encapsulation in java is achieved using private, protected and public keywords.



2.Architectural difference between selenium 3 & 4:

Selenium 3 working:
Selenium Client sends a selenium request & JSON Wire Protocol receives the same request through HTTP.
The Browser Driver is responsible for securing the request. In the end, “Server” returns
the “Response” and “Client” receives the same.


Selenium 4 working:
Selenium 4 - Selenium Client & WebDriver Language Bindings And the Browser Drivers are the server.
Selenium Client & WebDriver Language Bindings have their own language with unique bindings.
Here bindings reflect, that the command/request can be accessed by both the elements in their own languages.


Difference between 3 & 4:
1.Usage Of WebDriver Manager
2.Relative or Friendly Locator
toLeftOf(): Find the element to the left of a specified element.
toRightOf(): Find the element to the right of the specified element
above(): Find the element above with respect to the specified element.
below(): Find the element below with respect to the specified element.
near(): Find the element is at most 50 pixels far away from the specified element.
